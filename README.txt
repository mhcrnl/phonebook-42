Title: PHONEBOOK APPLICATION

Name: Sneha.A.Shinde	MIS: 111403044

Description:

I have created a phonebook application which allows the user to store personal information of his/her contacts in a very systematic manner.
It is a menu-driven application. 
It has 5 basic functions: 

To ADD a new record in the phonebook.
To DELETE a particular record stored in the phonebook. 
To MODIFY a particular record stored in the phonebook. 
To LIST all records of the phonebook.
To SEARCH a specified record in the phonebook.

The information it stores with respect to a particular record is the first name, middle name, last name, address, sex, e-mail id, mobile no., and date of birth.
It has an additional feature that the user can also assign a particular "group" to a given record which is pre-specified, namely- Family, Friends, Collegue, Emergency, None. This way the user can even list records of only one specific group according to his/her needs.
